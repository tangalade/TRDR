--------------------- ANALYSIS METHODS -----------------------------------------

How should analysis methods be organized?
 Analysis Method Dichotomies
  Input Size :
   whole market state VS 1 stock state
  Run times :
   set time between runs VS run once per input
  Output time parameters :
   Time variant VS time invariant

IF an analysis method analyzes 1 stock, THEN it is run once per input
IF an analysis method analyzes the whole market, THEN it has a set time between runs

With 1 minute or less bars being streamed to me, variation with time is not an issue.

Therefore, all analysis methods can be characterized as :
 Periodic Analysis Methods 
 Instant Analysis Methods

--------------------------- END ANALYSIS METHODS -------------------------------

--------------------------- BEGIN TDA API CLASSVIEW ----------------------------

TDA has an API. 
This API gives me an API Session.
This API session gives me everything that the API is designed to give me. 

---------------------------- END TDA API CLASSVIEW -----------------------------

----------------------------- BEGIN INSTANT ANALYSIS METHODS -------------------

Look the the TdaAmeritrade documentation for how to define an order. 

The analysis method INSTANTIATES and DEFINES the order
The analysis method SUBMITS this order to Tda Ameritrade
 This is done by CALLING the API method and GIVING it the defined order

----------------------------- END INSTANT ANALYSIS METHODS ---------------------

--------------------------- BEGIN SIMULATION THREAD ----------------------------

This thread should recieve orders from different analysis methods and simulate their execution. 
Different analysis method orders should not interfere with each other's execution
 because when this is up and working, I will only use 1 at a time
  until it's time to scale this more (I'll be lucky if I get here)
Simulation shouldn't be recording data; there should be a recorder for that

--------------------------- END SIMULATION THREAD ------------------------------

------------- BEGIN WHAT ITEMS QUALIFY FOR THEIR OWN THREADS? ------------------

Threads can only focus on one thing at a time. That is what limits them. 
Things that would require total focus : 
 reading the stream (read, then wait for next read)
 reading the console
 updating the GUI
 indicator analysis

------------- BEGIN CLASSES OF INDICATORS AND TRADING SYSTEMS ------------------

there are indicators for individual stocks. 
 some update throughout the day; others take longer
there are indicators for groups of stocks
 a group could be a: 
  market
  industry
  sector of an industry
 a group is DEFINED by the stocks that are in it

do Stocks have Indicators or do Indicators have Stocks?
 This question is not well defined. There are 2 types of indicators. Also, why
 should one possess the other. The indicators are generated by an AnalysisMethod

So then, an Instant Analysis Method (which affects only one stock) takes the 
most recently recieved stock record and submits the update to... 

AHA!

So then I want a local Data Structure to keep all my Stock data & analysis in 
one place. 

Indicators are just another form of Information about Stocks. 

Indicators are part of a Stock's State. 
Stock State's are updated by their records and things that analyze them. 
When I want to know anything about a stock, I am querying it's State
A State can remember what updates it has recieved.

StockStates are updated AT the Main Queue. They are ALL information stored. 
They have an onUpdate(StockRecord) function that updates their members. 
They are queried for ALL past info about a Stock. They also keep all the latest
indicators and analyses. 

The responsibilities of onUpdate are:
 - save & store current State
 - update current State
 - do a self-inspection routine to update it's indicators
 - once complete, submit THIS update to the TradingSystemThread

OR
 do a scripting lang. for any indicator I can think of!
 it makes indicators easy to update.
 I can even update & reload it in the GUI; it's exactly what I'm looking for

The scripting module can IMPORT all the various Indicators
