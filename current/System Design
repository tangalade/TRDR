The System

ABSTRACT
I see a GUI that updates as it recieves data. I can mess with it and the programming behind it.
Additionally, I can have algorithms that process the data and respond to it.
Finally, I can record data and program a meta-algorithm to process this
The recorder will be able to record the meta-algorithm's performance too.

THREADVIEW
 Stream Thread
  Roles
   recieves data from server
    keeps streaming session alive
    identifies "heartbeats" & quote information
   sends updates to GUI & analysis threads
 GUI Thread
  Roles
   Graphical User Interface
 Analysis Thread
  Roles
   Distributes messages to all analysis methods
   Runs analysis on most recent data every T seconds
    T = Max # of seconds required to do an update over all previous runs
    T = 0 (initially)

CLASSVIEW
 Main
  Roles
   initialization (TODO: define this)
   starts Stream, GUI, and Analysis Threads
 StreamThread
 StockRecord
 GUIThread
  has MessageQueue (updated by StreamThread)
 AnalysisThread
  has MessageQueue (updated by StreamThread)
 ConsoleInputThread (so the GUI doesn't stop updating while this happens)
